## Note

In case anyone reads this, the reason everything is packed into a single HTML
file is to make it simpler for someone to grab the file and run it locally; it's
not, at least initially, meant to be run on the web. I am not a psycho and I
did *not* write this from the ground up in this manner :)

Two bits of code were taken from W3Schools (slider) and StackOverflow
(randomizer algorithm), and they are credited with comments within the code.

### Pending

- Allow subsequent draws without clearing previous results for disabled members;
- Allow successive draws considering how many cases each member already
  received;
- Load member names from JSON;
- Allow for runtime adding of new members.
